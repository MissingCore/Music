 *  - Remove the use of the `MigrationOption` in earlier changes. This
 *  helps prevent duplicate logic from being run if the user updates to
 *  the latest version from a very old version.
 *  - Periodically update the migration code to work with the latest
 *  version and have it work with any new changes we added (ie: if we
 *  add a new schema field).
