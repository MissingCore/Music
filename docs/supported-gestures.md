# Supported Gestures

This document aims to document any gesture behavior/interactions that this app includes.

## Swipe for Actions

This involves swiping left on some content to reveal actions related to that content. It's currently present in the following features.

- **`Home Navigation`:** You can swipe on the home screen to navigate through the 6 different screens instead of using the navigation bar.
- **`Filter List Entries`:** You can swipe left to reveal the delete button on an allowlist or blocklist filter. This makes it harder to accidentally delete a filter (as this would require 2 steps to delete) as we've previously not had a modal to confirm the action.
- **`Queue List`:** You can swipe left on tracks that are part of the queue in the "Upcoming" modal (indicated by the `Q`) to reveal the remove button.
