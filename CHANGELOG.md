## [Unreleased]

The public release of `Music`, a Nothing inspired music player.

> This formatting is only for the first version of `Music` â€” proper "Keep a Changelog" formatting will follow after `Music`'s release.

### ðŸŽ‰ Features

At launch, `Music` provides the following features:

- Supports Android
- Play, Pause, Seek, Shuffle, Repeat
- Grouping Tracks by Albums (w/ Artwork), Artists, and Folder Structure
- Playlists w/ Custom Artwork
- Favoriting Albums, Playlists, and Tracks
- Background Playback w/ Media Control Notification
- Queues
- Automatically extraction of metadata w/ [@missingcore/react-native-metadata-retriever](https://github.com/MissingCore/react-native-metadata-retriever)
- Data Backup

#### ðŸ“‹ Queues

Have a track that pops up that you want to play next? Queues allows you to do this by adding tracks to a special list that "interrupts" the current track list by playing first. You want to jam to the same track over and over again â€” keep adding the track to the queue until you're satisfied.

#### ðŸ’¾ Automatic Saving & Cleanup

On app launch, `Music` will look for any new tracks added to your device and save its information in the app's database. This allows for quicker access to information about the track throughout the app without needing to read the file directly.

In addition, `Music` will detect any tracks deleted and remove them from any playlists that contain it. If it was in an album or belongs to an artist with no tracks, those entities will automatically be removed from view.

`Music` aims to keep its size small and delete any unnecessary resources.

### Data Backup

Export a `music_backup.json` file to help you switch between the APK & Google Play version of the app.
